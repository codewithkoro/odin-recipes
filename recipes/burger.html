    <!-- Below is a description of burger -->
    <p>A burger, also known as a hamburger, is a popular sandwich consisting of a cooked patty of ground meat,
    typically beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty is often seasoned and grilled or fried,
    and it can be topped with a variety of ingredients such as cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and condiments like ketchup
    and mustard. Burgers are commonly served with side dishes like french fries or coleslaw and are a staple of fast food cuisine worldwide.</p>
